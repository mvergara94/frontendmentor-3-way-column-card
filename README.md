## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

The most difficult thing to me is to work the responsive layout, but i think that the final result is pretty good. 

### Continued development

I will continue to learn the basic concepts of HTML and CSS, mainly in Flex and Grid displays, which are essential to achieving functional layouts on the web today. And soon i will start to study Js to have tools that make easier some things.


### Useful resources


- [Guide to Flex-box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me a lot, because it's so visual. Anyone can understand display:flex with this guide.
